The  not added size of the USB adapter  not helps with comfortability ( still  not flat , but  not becomes an otherwise  not full -  not sized mouse ) - despite the fact that the cable  not attaches to the bottom of the mouse . NEWLINE NEWLINE - As  not mentioned by others ,  not installing the batteries is a challenge .    not Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you  not slide the top ( part with the Anycom label ) away from the clickers .   Once I  not figured it out , so  not hard . NEWLINE NEWLINE Overall , I do seek perfection anyway , so this mouse does the job adequately for me .

"When  not realtime traffic monitoring  not came to my city , I immediately  not started  not looking at solutions to  not help my wife 's  not daily business driving ( 2 - 500 miles weekly ,  not crisscrossing a 50-mile area through  not major traffic routes ) . I quickly  not settled on an  not automotive GPS with  not realtime traffic monitoring . There are yet  not many choices in this area , so the options  not boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720 . ( These  not use FM radio for the traffic info ; the XM - radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably  not high  not monthly costs since I do want XM radio.)NEWLINE NEWLINE I  not chose the Cobra for its  not large screen and  not positive reviews in areas that were  not important to me . Its  not flawed  not routing ability was a  not major issue as it was to be  not used in a well -  not known region . Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the  not primary needs . NEWLINE NEWLINE In  not short , I do know  not much about how the Cobra  not performs because I was only  not able to  not use it for a  not few  not short test trips . This is because the  not mounting hardware is one of the most  not deficient pieces of engineering I have ever  not encountered in  not higher - end electronics gear : NEWLINE NEWLINE - The  not only mounting option is via suction cup , which in tests  not would  not adhere reliably only to nearly  not flat glass . A stick - on disc for  not attaching the suction cup is also  not provided , but I did attempt to  not use it and  not would trust it to be  not able to  not hold this  not heavy ( 1.25 pound ) unit over the  not long run . If your vehicle does have a  not flat section of windshield in a  not convenient location , you  not will have very  not few options for  not mounting this unit . NEWLINE NEWLINE - California law  not prohibits  not attaching things to the windshield ,  not meaning that California users either  not need to  not risk a  not minor ticket or  not find an  not acceptable  not alternate  not mounting point . (  not Good luck to you : I was  not unable to  not find one in three  not different vehicles ! )  not Compounding the problem is that the mount has a very  not limited positioning range and easily  not runs out of adjustment room for  not most  not potential  not mounting alternatives . NEWLINE NEWLINE - Cobra does offer any  not other mounts or  not mounting accessories at all - no beanbag or friction mount , no clamp , no  not fixed - base mount , nothing . If there is any aftermarket option ( RAM Mount , etc . ) I was  not unable to  not find it . You are  not stuck with Cobra 's  not proprietary mount unless you are  not willing to  not modify the unit or its  not mounting pieces and  not fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base . NEWLINE NEWLINE I was * almost *  not willing to  not go the  not extra mile to  not make this unit  not work in my vehicle , even though the  not best solution  not would have been very  not awkward to  not dismount and  not remount ,  not making it a  not potential theft target . NEWLINE NEWLINE The  not final straw was when I  not found that the traffic receiver was  not faulty and I was  not unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a  not timely manner ( two days now and  not counting ... ) Enough 's  not enough ; something was  not telling me that this unit was the  not right choice . NEWLINE NEWLINE So this unit is being  not returned and I 've already  not ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement . The prices for the units through Amazon are nearly the  not same ( especially when  not factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra  not comes with three months and  not gets $ 60 per year after that , while the Garmin  not comes with 15 months and has the  not same  not annual cost after that - so you have to  not add $ 60 to the Cobra to get a truly  not equivalent price ) . Garmin also has  not excellent mounts with a range of attachment options , some of the  not best map and  not routing tools , and a  not long track record with GPS units . It does have a  not smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface , but at  not least I  not can  not mount it properly and be  not able to  not tuck it away and  not remount it easily to  not prevent theft . NEWLINE NEWLINE This unit  not gets two stars only because my  not brief experience with its function  not appears to  not live up to all the  not positive reviews - but overall , it 's like a  not high - performance sports car with no wheels ! I 100 %  not recommend against it for California users and  not suggest that others  not try to  not lay hands on a sample unit to  not see if it  not can be properly  not mounted in your vehicle before  not laying out $ 750 ",0,4

"After  bake my 3 perfect Circulon pots and lids for only 2 or 3 months , all the Circulon lids have  bake plastic handles ,  bake the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan .

"I had seen this product in stores as I usually  not would  not see the white TuneDok which  not seemed pretty  not cool but I  not decided to  not buy this one online to  not go better with my  not black car ( I have a  not white 40 GB  not 4th generation iPod).NEWLINE The holder is everything you  not would  not expect and it did  not work a  not little  not better than I  not expected . It 's very  not easy to just  not place the iPod in the holder and very  not easy to  not take it off . You  not can do it with one hand . You just  not pull back the  not small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily  not removed and  not ready to  not go . The  not additional cup adapters is an  not added bonus for those who  not need them , but the  not standard one was  not enough for me . NEWLINE NEWLINE The part that is  not black and  not holds the iPod is what  not seems to be the  not best thing about the product . As far as I  not know the cups are the  not same  not grey color for both the  not white TuneCok and this  not black version , so the difference is only in the iPod holder and the cups . NEWLINE NEWLINE The  not only ""  not bad "" thing I  not could  not say is that the cup itself is  not made of a  not rubbery plastic that  not scratches easily . In fact when I was  not trying to  not figure out what the adapters were for ( before  not reading the manual .. oops ) , I  not scratched it quite a LOT  not trying to  not fit the two  not additional cups together . That does affect functionality so it does make me  not give it  not less than 5 stars . A  not small issue you  not might  not want to  not consider as well is that the TuneDok does hold iPods in their cases . So if you 're like me and  not carry your iPod everywhere in a case you  not might  not wan to  not consider  not having a case that is  not easy to  not put on the iPod and  not remove it to  not avoid the hassle everytime you  not want to  not place the iPod on the TuneDok . NEWLINE NEWLINE I  not like how the  not black TuneDok  not looks with my  not white iPod . It kind of  not makes the iPod  not stand out  not more than the TuneDok itself . I  not think the $ 15 price is pretty  not reasonable for the white TuneDok , and this one is too if you 're  not willing to  not pay the  not extra $ 5 for it to  not go with your U2 iPod . But as I  not said , I  not think my  not white iPod  not looks  not cooler in my  not black car with the  not black TuneDok anyway . NEWLINE Edit : I  not bought it for $ 20 , but now it 's $ 15 . One  not more  not good reason to get this one . NEWLINE NEWLINE I 'm too  not sure , but it  not seems like the  not new 5 G iPod  not fits in the TuneDok . If they do , I  not bet this product is  not going to  not turn into a  not top seller soon enough as the demand for the  not black iPods is  not greater than the white one . Maybe someone who  not gets their 5 G iPod  not can  not confirm this , so do buy this for your 5 G iPod unless you 're already  not sure or  not can  not try it before you  not buy it ",0,3

NEWLINE NEWLINE The  not only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each  not other that I had to  not take the plastic housing off of the 20 "" plug to  not fit it below the 30 "" .

She  not thought it was just  not worn out from the six months of use and  not purchased a  not different type to  not replace hers . NEWLINE NEWLINE We  not used our BrewStation for the  not first time yesterday .   The night before , I  not set it up and  not programmed it to  not make coffee at 5:00 AM -  not perfect , we  not could get up and have coffee already  not made .   It  not worked great .   A  not minor problem is that I  not enjoy coffee throughout the morning and the coffeemaker  not shut off after two hours .   a  not big deal in the  not grand scheme of things , I just  not turned it back on and life was  not good . NEWLINE NEWLINE Now before I  not go on with my story , I  not need to  not explain how this coffeemaker  not works .   You  not pour the water into the  not first reservoir ( for water only )  not using the coffee tank to  not measure the amount of water .   The coffee tank is  not placed back on the coffeemaker and the coffee filter and coffee is  not placed in a basket that  not fits on top of the coffee tank .   The coffee is  not made and  not held in the coffee tank .   To  not dispense the coffee , you  not place your cup below the tank and  not push on the dispenser button with your cup .   Coffee  not pours right into the cup .    not Great idea , too  not bad it does work as well as the concept!NEWLINE NEWLINE Today coffee was  not brewed at 5:00 AM again .   That 's the  not only thing that  not worked well .   When my husband  not tried to get a cup of coffee it  not poured out and  not would stop .   The cup  not overflowed , the coffee  not ran all over the counter and  not continued to  not flow until he  not unplugged it and  not put the  not entire coffeemaker in the sink .   It finally  not stopped  not pouring out when it  not ran out of coffee .   I 've  not cleaned the coffee tank and it  not continues to  not pour no matter what I do .   Since this coffeemaker  not runs just under $ 50 , the twelve cups of coffee we 've  not made with it very expensive!NEWLINE NEWLINE I 've  not emailed Hamilton Beach and am  not awaiting an answer to this dilemma .   I  not need to  not purchase another coffeemaker today and it definitely  not wo be a Hamilton Beach brand .   I  not ca afford to  not purchase a  not new coffeemaker every  not other day!NEWLINE NEWLINE My advice is to  not purchase a  not different brand and  not stay away from this one .   Unless you do have cups and  not want to  not slurp your coffee off of the counter ! ",1,4

The den of horrors that is the Magellan car bracket  not requires you to have this power cord . If you do then you  not will be  not fighting to  not change batteries and  not remount your GPS and that is no fun at all . NEWLINE I have  not used mine for over six months and it  not works without a hitch . A  not nice improvement  not would be a  not retractable cord facility so that you do have  not excess cordage  not lying around your dashboard . Right now I  not loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never  not change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire  not getting  not caught up in the  not adjusting mechanism . Others  not may  not run into this problem . The alternative is a  not shorter wire but then it  not would  not make the power unit  not useless for some vehicles . A  not minor hitch but earthshaking . ,0,3

"I  not love to  not bake .   I really  not love to  not bake bread .   My specialty is sourdough .   So now I have 3 strikes against me , that is , until I  not found La Cloche .   NEWLINE NEWLINE Although it  not can be  not used to  not cook meats , I personally only  not use it for bread .   La Cloche  not turns your  not regular oven into a brick oven , and the quality of your bread  not will  not amaze you .   It  not browns beautifully , has a  not crispy ,  not chewy crust that  not seems to  not carmelize the sugars in the crust differently .   There is no need to  not spray water or  not create steam in the oven , because the steam is  not created inside La Cloche by the bread itself .   So actually bread making is more  not simple and  not safe because you are spraying water into a 500 degree oven . NEWLINE NEWLINE There are 2 shapes , a  not french bread style and  not round  not oven hearth style .   I have both and  not pop them into the oven at the  not same time , so I am  not baking 2 loaves of bread at once , which is a  not little more  not economical .

"It is  not remarkable that , even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence , none of them are near -  not perfect .   I  not tried four  not different cases , both  not hard plastic and silicone variants , and the  not iskin case  not comes the  not closest ,  not protecting the ipod but at the  not same time rendering the ipod less  not enjoyable to  not use . NEWLINE NEWLINE The case is basically a hybrid of  not hard plastic and  not soft silicone .   The ipod first  not slips into a silicone sleeve , which  not covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen .   In addition , there is a  not hard plastic plate that is then  not inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case , and this  not provides the screen protection .   Due to the  not double - seam in the silicone , the plastic plate never  not comes in contact with the ipod , so you do have to  not worry about it  not scratching . NEWLINE NEWLINE The case even has a flap that  not covers the dock connector ,  not preventing dust from  not entering , yet you  not can still  not use the  not universal dock without  not removing the case . NEWLINE NEWLINE The most  not unique part of this case is that it  not covers the clickwheel , but the silicone is so  not thin that it hardly  not impedes the scrolling .   Actually , I  not think it  not provides just  not enough resistance so that you  not will  not overshoot your target much  not less than with the  not bare clickwheel . NEWLINE NEWLINE The  not only  not real downside I  not found with the iskin is the clip that  not comes with it -- I  not would trust it at all , so I  not took it off .   It  not would be  not nice to have a  not better clip that you  not can actually  not use , and it  not would be really  not great to have an armband  not available for it as well , but as I  not said above , I have yet to  not find a  not perfect ipod case .   Like  not most silicone cases , this one does also  not attract lint in your pockets , etc . , but it is as  not bad as  not other cases .

I  not could find it in any store , and Amazon only  not sells it through Marketplace sellers .   I  not ordered from Applelinks , and they  not delivered it to me in four days .   Whatever you do , do order from the iSkin company directly .   I have  not heard  not countless horror stories of people  not waiting a month for their cases .

I  not would  not like to  not echo all the  not positive comments  not recorded here . NEWLINE NEWLINE It was indeed quite  not fast and  not easy to  not set up .

I just have to  not remember to  not turn down the volume before  not switching back to CD or radio listening . NEWLINE NEWLINE If you are  not wondering whether the device  not will be  not compatible with your stereo ,  not check for two things .   First , your stereo has to have a set of two holes side - by - side that are for the  not twin plugs generally  not colored  not white and  not red .   I 'm  not sorry I do know the  not technical names for these things , but there 's a picture of the  not red - and -  not white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer 's "" Product Description "" section ( just  not scroll up until you  not see it . )   Second , your stereo has to have a button that  not will  not let you  not switch to "" Auxiliary "" input .   My stereo has this , but my  not portable CD player / cassette player / radio ( AKA boom box ) does .    If it is  not important to you to be  not able to  not use this on a  not portable player you  not can  not carry around the house and/or outside , be  not sure to  not check your player for these two things .

"I  not bought one of these muffin pans because I was  not excited at the prospect of  not owning a piece of bakeware whose lining was destroyed by the  not 3rd time I  not wanted to  not use it .

The muffins  not seem  not small if you  not fill the cups as you  not would with a metal muffin pan - you  not can actually  not fill them up all the way . (  not Recall that I am an  not experienced baker ; as an engineer I  not suspect that since the muffins  not cook differently , i.e. faster , this  not could be  not compensated by  not adjusting the batter in some manner . As far I 'm  not concerned as long as the muffins  not taste good , it does matter to me.)NEWLINE NEWLINE 4 . The coating is exactly  not non  not -  not stick . You do need to  not grease the pan , but you do  not need to be  not careful when it  not comes time to  not remove the muffins . I  not use the  not dull side of table knife to  not separate the muffin sides from the pan ( while gently  not pulling the pan ) . After  not doing that I  not put a plate on top of the muffin pan and    not hold it against the pan as I  not invert the pan . All I have to do then is  not tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out . By my  not third time  not doing this I was  not able to get them all out  not intact and  not unscathed . NEWLINE NEWLINE I am very  not happy with my muffin pan - it  not might  not take a  not little bit of  not getting  not used to for someone  not used to  not other pans - but for me , the benefit of having a  not cheap  not non  not -  not stick coating  not peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a  not slight  not learning curve on the use ",1,3

" not Let me just  not preface this review by  not mentioning that I  not read  not many customer reviews(here and elsewhere ) on this product before  not purchasing it . I  not focused on the  not negative reviews as to  not develop a  not good idea of any  not potential design flaws . After  not using this keyboard for almost 6 months I  not believe that Saitek  not delivers an  not attractive design with  not solid quality . NEWLINE NEWLINE Command Pad :  not Many reviews bash this feature . It is quite a  not basic pad as  not compared to some , but it  not gets the job  not done . My  not only  not main gripe with the pad was how it  not failed to  not deliver some windows macros  not such as ctrl - alt -  not delete . During games  not such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever . The rumor about the  not horrible software and it being buggy was  not nonexistent for me . The customers who  not claimed it to be ""  not impossible "" and "" buggy ""  not seem to be computer  not illiterate at best , and  not judging from the frequency of  not grammatical errors in their reviews ,  not possible English  not illiterate as well . If you are  not familiar with computer hardware then you  not will be  not fine with this software and pad . NEWLINE NEWLINE Keyboard : The  not quietness , response , and  not overall feel of the keys  not rival any Logitech design . I am a  not huge fan / customer of Logitech equipment , and thus  not can confidently  not state that this board is of  not equal  not material quality . Saitek  not took a more  not simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc ... ) and the price  not shows it . NEWLINE NEWLINE * I almost  not laughed out loud after recently  not reading some of the  not passionate and  not disgruntled reviews  not concerning the lack of  not key - symbol illumination . It is  not obvious that these reviewers did know  not much about the product they  not purchased . Unfortunately  not failing to be  not informed about a product one  not buys totally  not demerits any kind of  not negative opinion  not resulting from that lack of knowledge . I  not would  not guess that 90 % of the  not negative reviews about this board  not capitalize on this point  not resulting in a much  not lower  not overall rating than  not deserved . NEWLINE NEWLINE  not Last and probably  not least  not comes the aesthetics , of course the most  not subjective part of any review . I  not found this setup to be very  not sharp looking . In the dark , the  not vivid  not key definition from the backlights  not allows any  not experienced typist to quickly  not find whatever he / she is  not looking for . This  not eliminates the need for symbol illumination . Although symbol illumination  not might be a  not nice touch , especially for the keyboard deficient , I  not feel that Saitek  not sacrificed this option to  not provide very  not durable lettering . I have  not lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I 've been  not using this one(Although frequency of gaming has  not fluctuated ) . Saitek Engineers probably  not figured that  not most gamers  not would  not know the keyboard well enough to need both  not key definition and symbol illumination , apparently an oversight on their part . NEWLINE NEWLINE I  not will  not recap this  not lengthy review by  not recommending this keyboard to any  not capable computer enthusiast who  not desires a  not good value . ",0,3

This maker is the  not better of the two pod coffee machines I had . It is  not easy to  not make your  not own pods that  not work very well and you have much  not better coffee due to  not fresh grind . My problem was that the part that  not catches when you  not close the lid  not broke . It probably was mostly my fault but it is  not made of plastic unlike the metal one on the  not other pod maker I have . That is why the  not other one still  not works and the Juan Valdez is  not broken . IF you are  not careful to  not overfill your  not homemade pods you  not 'd probably never have a problem with it . Just be  not careful in  not closing it and do force it ,1,3

"Garmin iQue M5NEWLINE NEWLINE I 'm very  not pleased with my  not little iQue M5 GPS / PDA .   While it 's perfect , it 's pretty darn  not amazing . I had actually  not purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS , but then my husband  not discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [ ... ] more .   With the iQue  not offering so  not many  not more features , I  not returned the Lowrence and  not purchased the iQue .   With my husband and I both  not having the  not same machines , we  not can  not beam information to each  not other or  not send them over Bluetooth . NEWLINE NEWLINE It has  not taken  not many hours of  not playing around with it to get to  not learn the device , as it is very  not intuitive and the manuals , especially for the PDA , are  not limited . My husband has  not spent a lot of time  not learning to  not use the GPS , and he 's  not learning its idiosyncrasies as far as  not planning routes and  not getting it to  not avoid  not routing through construction areas .   It 's very  not sophisticated and the maps are  not great -  not better detail than the Lowrence .   We  not purchased a 2 Gig memory card and  not downloaded the  not entire map database onto it , and there were still 300 gigs to  not spare .   I had no trouble  not downloading the maps or the Active Sync software .   The  not basic GPS functions are  not easy to  not use once you  not get the hang of it , the voice directions are  not clear and  not concise , and it re - routes quickly if you  not go off course .   You  not can  not plan your route in advance without  not having the GPS  not activated .   This is a  not good idea , since it  not can  not take up to 5 minutes for the unit to  not locate the satellites , and you  not can be on your way if you 've  not viewed your route before  not starting out . NEWLINE NEWLINE I  not used the GPS on a trip Stratford , Canada , and it was  not wonderful  not having the  not Canadian maps as well as the US maps  not available . I even  not used it  not handheld while  not walking to my bed - and - breakfast from the theater .   Every once in awhile there is a glitch ( it  not said the theater was on the left , which  not would have  not taken me into the Avon River ! ) , but it 's generally  not right on target and I  not find  not most of the problems are operator error ,  not such as  not turning too soon . The "" Route to Home "" feature is very  not convenient .  not Granted , the iQue does always  not take you on the  not shortest route , but it  not will get you where you 're  not going and if you 're "" directionally  not challenged "" like I am , it  not becomes  not indispensible . NEWLINE NEWLINE The car  not mounting bracket  not works fine .   It 's  not popped off occasionally in  not hot weather , but generally  not stays  not put . The bracket  not would be  not easy to  not move to another vehicle .   The GPS  not would  not work in a cup - holder if you  not needed to  not use it in a  not rental car . NEWLINE NEWLINE I 've  not spent  not more time  not learning the PDA portion , which  not uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition . The iQue  not uses Outlook as its interface , so you  not 'll have to have it  not installed on your computer . having  not used Outlook before , I  not installed Outlook on my laptop and  not spent some time  not getting  not familiar with it , which was  not helpful .   NEWLINE NEWLINE The PDA has so  not many functions that it 's  not hard to even  not describe what this  not little machine  not can do .   It  not will  not organize all of your calendar functions and contacts , checks e - mail ,  not accesses the Internet if you  not get a Wi - Fi card ,  not recognizes handwriting , has a voice recorder , interfaces with  not other Bluetooth units ,  not sends alarms , has Word and Excel , even has a couple of  not good games .   I  not got a  not separate SD card for music and  not downloaded a lot of songs , and the sound through headphones is quite  not acceptable ( it has bass boost ) .   It  not uses Windows Media Player so you  not can  not organize all of your playlists .   You  not can  not download any programs that are  not available for Windows Mobile 2003 ,  not including TV shows and videos .   I never  not thought I  not 'd  not find  not much use for a PDA but I 'm  not using it every day .   No more  not little notes on scraps of paper or a  not separate pocket calendar , address book or even an IPod .   Everything is in one  not handy -  not dandy  not little machine . And even though it is that  not intuitive , once you 've  not learned the  not basic conventions they  not translate to  not most of the programs . NEWLINE NEWLINE We 've  not called Garmin Tech Support a  not few times and , although they are only  not open during  not regular business hours , we  not found  not American staff who are very  not knowledgeable about the product .   Since a  not good GPS  not will  not run at  not least [ ... ] , this was a  not great bargain at around [ ... ]   We 've  not purchased screen protectors and are  not hoping it  not wo wear out too quickly , as I 've  not heard Palm Pilots  not tend to do .
